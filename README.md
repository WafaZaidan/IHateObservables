## Why I built this simple observable
I hate observables so in order to understand them, my colleague suggested that I build my own. 

I wasted sometime at the beginning by starting to code immediately which made me even more confused about observables so I decided to draw it. The drawing took me less than 10 minutes and the code took less than 15. 

For the future, dear Wafa, please plan before you code and hate more code so you push yourself to write your own version of it so you can understand it better. 

## Example in the code
To make this easier to understand, I made up an example in my head that is completely un inspired by a real life story.
- Vendor Asos has nice clothes
- Customer Wafa likes shopping.
- Vendor Asos has an item out of stock and Wafa has her eyes on it
- Wafa registers an interest in the item so that Asos notifies Wafa when its back in stock
- Luckily, within 5 seconds of running the script, Asos gets the item back in stock and notifies Wafa yayy!
- Wafa immediately buys the item before any other customer and its a happy ending :hamster-dance:

Thank you observables <3
