I hate observables so in order to understand them, my colleague suggested that I build my own. 
I wasted sometime at the beginning by starting to code immediately which made me even more confused about observables so I decided to draw it. The drawing took me less than 10 minutes and the code took less than 15. 
For the future, dear Wafa, please plan before you code and hate more code so you push yourself to write your own version of it so you can understand it better.
